## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load packages, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggspatial)
library(ggthemes)
library(raster)
```

## St_Read Tryout

```{r st_read}

wards <- st_read("wards_precincts.geojson")
neighborhoods <- st_read("BOUNDARY_CDDNeighborhoods.shp.zip")
```
##libraries <- st_read("library_locations.xml")

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r cambridge_plot test, echo=FALSE}

cambridge_plot <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = wards, color = "blue") +
  geom_sf(data = neighborhoods, color = "green", alpha = 0.5)
  

```

```{r maptest}

ggplot() +
  annotation_map_tile(zoomin = 0, progress = "none", type = "stamenbw") +
  geom_sf(data = wards, color = "blue", alpha = 0.05) +
  geom_sf(data = neighborhoods, color = "green", alpha = 0.05) +
  labs(caption = "Map tiles by Stamen Design. Data by OpenStreetMap")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
